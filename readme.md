# Domain Expiry Notification

This project is a Python script that sends notifications about domain expiry dates via Google Chat and email. It retrieves domain information from a file, checks the expiry dates, and sends notifications if the expiry date is within 30 days.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/domain-expiry-notification.git](https://github.com/amit-successive/godaddy-domain-expiry-checker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd domain-expiry-notification
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a file named `.env` in the project directory.
2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   GODADDY_API_KEY=your_godaddy_api_key
   GODADDY_API_SECRET=your_godaddy_api_secret
   GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL=your_google_chat_webhook_url
   SENDER_EMAIL=your_sender_email
   SENDER_PASSWORD=your_sender_password
   RECIPIENT_EMAIL=your_recipient_email
   ```

   Replace `your_godaddy_api_key`, `your_godaddy_api_secret`, `your_google_chat_webhook_url`, `your_sender_email`, `your_sender_password`, and `your_recipient_email` with the appropriate values.

## Usage

1. Create a file named `domain_list.txt` in the project directory.
2. Add the domain names, each on a separate line, to the `domain_list.txt` file.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
   python domain_expiry_notification.py
   ```

   The script will retrieve the expiry dates for the domains in `domain_list.txt` and send notifications if the expiry date is within 30 days.
   It will also print the domain list with expiry dates in tabular form.

   **Note:** Ensure that the environment variables in the `.env` file are correctly configured before running the script.
